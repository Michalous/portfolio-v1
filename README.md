# Unit 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Implementation

This is my first portfolio website. I recently created a website for a fictitious product (https://michalous.github.io/lightlander-website) which I've built using a Bootstrap template. I tried to imitate it's layout and style using only tools that we went through during the lessons. For that reason there is no JavaScript included.

Most of the projects listed here are not about looks but about functionality. I'm hoping to add some visually appealing stuff here as I will learn more about front end development.
