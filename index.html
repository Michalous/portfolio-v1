        <p>My name is Michal. I was born in North-East Czech Republic in 1981. I currently live with my wife and children in probably the most beautiful part of England - somewhere on the border between Kent and East Sussex.</p>
        <p>I’m interested in software development and computational problem solving. I’m working hard to make a transition into tech and the purpose of this website is to help me in my endeavour.</p>

              <h3>Bubble sort visualization</h3>
              <p>I first saw this visualization in one of the online CS lessons and decided to give it a try and build one for myself. It was one of very frustrating experiences. I wanted to build it with JS canvas but it didn't work for me as I don't fully understand how JavaScript is rendering the data on canvas. It worked in Python and it works in JS with Plotly but for some reason not with canvas.</p>

              <h3>Hangman</h3>
              <p>I've built this game after finishing CS50x final project - finance. The design is borrowed from the project (it's built in Flask) and game was inspired by other project - MIT's intro to CS with Python. This is a fusion of 2 projects. You have to register to play. This was my very first attempt to deploy a webapp and today I would build it differently.</p>
